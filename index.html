        <p>Hello my name is Tyler, I'm currently in the making of becoming a Full Web Developer. I don't usually like to do much but to hangout with my friends or just simply relaxing.
        Some of my favorite things to attend to are music festivals and concerts. My hobbies include weightlifting, painting, listening to music, or just playing video games.
        <br><br>
        <p>Other random things about me; I love to watch anime and cooking videos! I'm not the best at cooking but I do enjoy watching and learning.
        I may not look like but I do enjoy having genuine conversations with people and love to learn about new things everyday. I come from a very shy background but I'm hoping
        to grow with this course!</p>
